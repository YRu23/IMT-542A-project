# Quality Control and Ethics

## Transparency
Be honest and transparent in collecting and presenting data from various sources such as movie ratings and reviews from IMDb, TMDb, and Metacritic. Also, present accurate information from reliable sources without modification. Be clear with the attributes, for example, each rating system is different and should clearly indicate the resources to ensure the quality and credibility of the data. Openly disclose the approaches of calculating the overall rating process, like algorithms and methods, as it allows users to clearly understand how the data was combined and enhanced. This will increase the reliability of the data and help in minimizing potential biases.

## Integrity
Be respectful to all types of users. The data should be treated with respect and should be used for the intended purposes and should be kept secure. Transparency in user data privacy. Inform users that their data is collected and be clear about how it is used. Furthermore, ensure all types of data in the system are handled securely and accurately to prevent data manipulation, unauthorized access, and potential data leaks.

## Consequential Ethics

### Enhancing Decision-Making and Accessibility
Help users to make informed decisions about movie ratings by integrating movie ratings from multiple sources and providing a comprehensive view of each movie’s reception. The centralized information from streaming platforms and rating systems can reduce the effort required for users to access and compare movie ratings one by one, making it easier for users to find all content in one place.

### Respect Data Ownership and Partnership
Make sure to comply with the data policies from the original sources. This includes negotiating data usage and APIs that are provided by the services and following the usage guidelines and limitations. Instead of extracting data, forming partnerships with other rating systems to drive more user traffic. For example, driving traffic back to the original site through links for detailed reviews might be beneficial to both stakeholders.

## Non-Consequential Ethics

### Legal Concern in Using Data
The usage and aggregation of data from different sources should comply with their terms of service. Moreover, permissions or licenses are required to access the data instead of scraping data.

### Accessibility
Ensure the system is easy for all types of users to access and explore, regardless of language and skills in data analytics.

## Limitations

### Data Availability
The movie rating project heavily depends on the availability and quality of data from various movie rating platforms. The structure of each resource may have inconsistencies or inaccuracies that could highly impact the reliability of the overall rating results.

### Metric Accuracy
The diverse rating scales from different movie rating systems could be one of the main challenges to start and maintain. It requires converting these ratings into a unified scale that can help in proceeding with the data.

### Concern of Intellectual Property
This project might violate intellectual property rights as it aggregates data from diverse sources.

### Dependency on External Data Resources
The project relies on data from external movie rating systems and streaming platforms that may have changes or updates without prior notice. Changes in data policies or data resources could disrupt the service.

## Social Impact

### Create a Diversity of Movies
This project can help niche films find their audience, supporting movies that might not have large marketing budgets or have specific types of audiences. This also provides users a space to find movies that match their interests instead of following the public’s movie ratings.

## Availability

### Data Partnership
To avoid violating intellectual property rights by using external data, forming a partnership with the movie rating platforms and streaming services could help in ensuring stable and reliable access to data legally.

### Data Management
Adapt to the changes in data sources (structure or rating metrics) to minimize the error in generating overall results in its own system. Be aware of the updates and timeline among the external data to minimize the bias/error of rating results due to different times.
