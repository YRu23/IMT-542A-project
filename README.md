# IMT-542A-project - Movie Ratings

## About the project:
This project is dedicated to developing an application that consolidates movie ratings from three major sources: IMDb, TMDb, and Metacritic. The application aims to provide a comprehensive view of each movie's reception across these platforms, enabling users to access aggregated ratings in a single, unified interface. By focusing on these prominent movie rating systems, the application helps users make informed viewing choices based on the ratings from these trusted sources.

## Problem statement:
Currently, movie ratings are dispersed across multiple platforms, making it cumbersome for users to gather a holistic view of a movie's reception. Users often have to visit multiple websites or perform separate searches to see ratings from IMDb, TMDb, and Metacritic. This fragmented approach not only wastes time but also complicates the decision-making process for movie enthusiasts who rely on these ratings to choose what to watch. The lack of integration among these platforms leads to inefficiency and a fragmented user experience.

## Solution:
This application addresses the issue by aggregating movie ratings from IMDb, TMDb, and Metacritic into a single, unified view. It calculates an average rating from these main platforms, providing users with a clear and comprehensive overview. By offering a centralized platform for movie ratings, the application simplifies the process of accessing and comparing movie ratings, enabling users to make more informed viewing choices based on a blend of ratings from these established sources. Users could have visual friendly views that only require minimun skills to understand the data. API access to the datasets were also provided on top of the application page, which allow users to access, analyze and explore more through the dataset. 

## Wireframe:
Low-fedility wireframe were provided to have an overview how the application would look like. 
The wireframe is shown in the IMT 542 project presentation.pdf.
