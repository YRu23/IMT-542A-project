# Measure the capability of FAIR implementation

Movie Rating Aggregator is an open-source data repository designed to aggregate and provide access to movie ratings and related metadata from IMDb, TMDb, and Metacritic. Each dataset in the repository is assigned a unique identifier, facilitating easy discovery, citation, and access to the original resource (F, I). Detailed information, such as metadata timestamps, the timeline of ratings, and the analytic structure to integrate the rating values, is included to ensure comprehensive data representation (F, R).
Users can access detailed metadata through a landing page that includes basic information such as the movie name, ratings, and an overview, which remains available even if the primary data is restricted or removed (F, A). The platform provides a user-friendly interface for data retrieval and exploration, ensuring that data is accessible and searchable for all types of users (A, R). This structure enhances the reusability of data by maintaining high-quality metadata and supporting community standards for data sharing and citation (R).
