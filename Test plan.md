# Test Plan

The purpose of the test is to ensure that the movie rating application meets both functional requirements and performance expectations, providing users with a high-quality, reliable, and user-friendly experience. The main areas that will be tested are movie search functionality, movie rating features for users, and API performance and reliability.

## Functional Tests

### Integration Tests
- **Objective**: Ensure that all components work well together seamlessly.
- **Importance**: Detect interface defects and issues that arise when combining different parts of the system, such as third-party integrations like the IMDb API.
- **Method**:
  - Test the integration of different components, including the user interface, database, and external APIs.
  - Verify that data flows correctly between the components and that any data transformations are accurate.
  - Check error handling and fallback mechanisms when external APIs fail or return unexpected results.

### End-to-End Testing
- **Objective**: Simulate user scenarios to ensure that the entire system workflow functions correctly from beginning to end.
- **Importance**: Identify potential issues that might be missed in unit or integration testing, ensuring that the application works together to deliver the expected outcome.
- **Method**:
  - Create user scenarios that cover all major functionalities, such as searching for movies, submitting ratings, and viewing friend ratings.
  - Execute these scenarios in a test environment, simulating real user interactions.
  - Verify that each step in the scenario completes successfully and that the final outcome matches the expected results.

## Performance Test

### Load Testing
- **Objective**: Simulate the expected number of users accessing the system simultaneously to understand the system's limits and ensure it performs smoothly under typical usage scenarios.
- **Method**:
  - Use load testing tools to simulate concurrent users accessing the application.
  - Monitor system performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization during the test.
  - Identify bottlenecks or performance degradation points and optimize the system accordingly.

## Test Execution

1. **Preparation**:
   - Set up a test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.
   - Prepare test data, including user accounts, movie ratings, and API keys for external services.
   - Define test cases and scenarios based on the objectives and methods outlined above.

2. **Execution**:
   - Run integration tests first to ensure that individual components are interacting correctly.
   - Follow up with end-to-end tests to verify that user scenarios work as expected.
   - Conduct load testing to evaluate system performance under simulated user load.

3. **Reporting**:
   - Document the results of each test, including any issues encountered and their severity.
   - Summarize findings in a test report, highlighting areas that need improvement.
   - Provide recommendations for fixing defects and optimizing performance.

## Test Coverage

- **Functional Tests**:
  - Movie search functionality
  - User movie rating submission
  - Integration with IMDb, TMDb, and Metacritic APIs

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Response time under load
  - System throughput
  - Resource utilization

## Conclusion

The testing plan ensures comprehensive coverage of both functional and performance aspects of the movie rating application. By executing integration tests, end-to-end tests, and load tests, we aim to deliver a robust and user-friendly application that meets the highest standards of quality and reliability.
